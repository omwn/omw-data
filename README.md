# omw-data

This packages up data for the Open Multilingual Wordnet.  It is roughly the version that is described in Bond and Foster (2013).

The raw data (under *wns*) also has the automatically extracted data
for over 150 languages from Wiktionary and the ‎Unicode Common Locale
Data Repository.


The directory *wns* has the wordnet data from OMW 1.2 with some small fixes
 * added a citation for the Icelandic wordnet
 * added human readable citations in ``omw-citations.tab``


If you use OMW plesae cite both the citation below, and the individual wordnets (citation data is included in each wordnet):
